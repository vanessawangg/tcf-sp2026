This week, I learned about the different parts of frontend development and why each one is important in creating a successful webpage. HTML is responsible for the structure of the page and defines what content appears on it. CSS focuses on presentation and controls the visual look, including colors, styling, and layout. JavaScript is responsible for user interaction and the behavior of the webpage, allowing the page to respond when users click, type, or interact with elements. All three work together to create a complete and functional website.

Using a framework like Next.js feels different from writing raw HTML and CSS. When using plain HTML and CSS, you have to organize everything yourself and manage multiple files manually. With Next.js, a lot of the setup is already handled for you. It organizes pages clearly and makes it easier to build and reuse components. This makes the development process feel faster and more organized compared to building everything from scratch, reducing the chances of mistakes when linking files. 

TypeScript, Tailwind, and Next.js each play a different role in building the project. Next.js is the main framework that organizes the app and connects everything together. It handles the pages and structure of the website. TypeScript helps make the code safer by catching errors early and making sure variables are used correctly. This makes it easier to avoid mistakes while coding. Tailwind is used for styling. Instead of writing separate CSS files, Tailwind lets you add styling directly in the className using built-in utility classes. Together, these tools work well because Next.js manages the structure, TypeScript improves reliability, and Tailwind makes styling faster and simpler.
